        <p>Heather Donahue was born in Upper Darby, PA, but soon relocated to Baltimore, on the outskirts of which her great-grandmother lived. Some of Heather's earliest memories are of her great-grandma's tales of civil war ghosts and witches said to haunt the area. While Heather relished the terror those stories inspired in her early on, she later came to appreciate the historical and sociological value that this oral tradition provided. She made it her mission to investigate and document the origins of these stories, primarily as an act of preservation.</p>

    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Moving out on her own to Wheaton, Maryland in 1991, this led her to Montgomery College in Rockville, where she studied video production. After saving money she earned as the videographer of countless weddings and bar mitzvahs, she began planning her first major project, a documentary on the story of her great-grandmothers that both fascinated and frightened her the most, the story that resurfaced so often in both history and her own mind -- the legend of the Blair Witch.</p>
