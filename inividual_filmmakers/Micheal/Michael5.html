        <h1><strong>This biography was found with the filmmakers' equipment. The handwriting has been identified as that of Michael Williams.</strong></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Michael Williams was born on January 23, 1973 to Louis and Lorraine Williams in a hospital in Washington D.C. At the age of 5, Mike won first prize in kindergarten for the best drawing of a fish. Since then he has won absolutely nothing except for "Least Likely to Succeed" in his graduating year of high school in suburban Rockville MD.</p>

    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Graduating one year later than the rest of his classmates due to too many absences in gym class, Mike decided that college wasn't for him. At 19 years old, he decided to head to St. Petersburg FL to work on a fishing boat called "The Old Kensico." Three months later he was back living at home as the captain had thrown Mike off of his crew because the captain believed that Mike should at least try his hand at college. He returned home on Captain Gehrig's advice and enrolled part-time at Montgomery College. For two years Mike pumped gas for his on-and-off girlfriend Jennifer's father and went to school part-time. He took an interest in communications, particularly in radio where he hosted a show called "The Whisky Hour" with his friend Phill on the campus radio station. He was now 22 and was happier with his life than probably any other time due to the success of his radio show.</p>

    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>He had also taken two courses in sound mixing and editing for film which is where he met Joshua Leonard. Leonard and Williams took a liking to each other and spent many weekends together drinking beers and talking over their futures. They threw together a commercial for the gas station that Mike had been working at as a project for school and knew at that point that they worked well together. Mike hadn't heard from Josh at all in the summer of 1994 until late August when Josh called and asked him if he would like to join himself and Heather Donahue in shooting Heather's senior thesis project about the local legend of the Blair Witch. Mike knew that the legend was all b.s. and wasn't too keen on camping (he'd rather sleep in a warm bed any day) but he accepted the job because he knew he could learn alot from Josh and the experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Oh, in July Mike got another part-time job mixing sound for a company that did industrials called Westlake Productions. Josh was thrilled to learn that Mike could score a free DAT for the weekend. And apparently so was Heather.</p>

        <p>So begins Mike's role in The Blair Witch Project.</p>
