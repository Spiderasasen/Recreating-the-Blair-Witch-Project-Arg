    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Joshua Leonard began his filmmaking career at 9 years old, documenting local sporting events and family gatherings on his father's 8mm Bell & Howell. Later, in his high school years he wrote and directed his own TV show "MD. Skunk" which quickly became a local favorite of the Rockville youth culture as well as the highest rated midnight show on WQED cable channel 3. "MD. Skunk" was noted for its unique mixture of skateboarding tricks and punk rock concert footage cleverly edited with stock car chases and classic gun fights.</p>

    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Joshua later attended and graduated from the television program at Montgomery Community College (MCC). At MCC he learned an array of filmmaking techniques, including on-line Beta editing, basic sound design, 3-point lighting, and 16mm film production.</p>

    <div class="text_container_custom">
        <p>Joshua is currently working as a commercial videographer for TCI productions and has recently completed directing his own 30 second spot entitled "Nuns With Guns" for The Laugh Factory comedy club and restaurant.</p>
