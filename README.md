# Recreating-the-Blair-Witch-Project-Arg
This is going to an entire recreation of the Blair Witch Arg website. it will dedicate to my professor because he looked so memorized about the website in class, 10/22/25. If he one day see's it, which I might send to him, I will include a pass word system in an about me area that will be the whole class thanking him for the class we had with him.

# creating the main page
The main page will try to recreate the webpage that used to exist back then. with all the info we have available from the internet archives and the way back machine.

# new addition?
simple, there will be an about page that will say that I wanted to recreate the page as a way to honor the memory the original page and also have 2 different passwords
1. if the password is 1999, it will show what I used to get as close as the original page
   1. its 1999 to respect the first film that was created
2. if the password is 3700, it's a way to say a thank you to the professor that remined me of this amazing page.
   1. he looked so memorized by the website, well the little bits that used to be there
   2. I will also include a quote from everyone that took the class with him for this unit
   3. a final image that will depict all of us
3. I also made this into my main project for my German/Fantisy class. It was fun to add all the things here and also explain everything here
