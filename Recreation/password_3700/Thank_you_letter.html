            <p>Well, this is the end of the class. Am i sad about it, yes, yes i am. Not only did this class give me the joy of reading, but it also gave me the joy of working more on what I enjoy, so I can read everything more accurately. But also coming out with something that can help me with my life. The hero's journey. That on its own can help anyone heal from so much pain, while yes it describes how our favorite characters react, but apply it to yourself and you’ll learn how to survive even while you are the lowest of lows, for yes the abyss is scary but in our own story of life we can climb back up and be the hero in our journey. Not only the hero's journey, but finally letting me see stories in more ways than I could, and actually enjoy them. That and also showing me that, yeah, everyone might see one message, but seeing another message is also amazing to see. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you. You really became the messenger to not only your kin, but also to us by showing us that your job as a messenger was successful and will always be successful.<br> <br>Thank you.</p>
