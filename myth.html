            <p>Several children accuse <a class="new_color" href="myth_sections/Kedward/Kedward1.html">Elly Kedward</a> of luring them into her home to draw blood from them. Kedward is found guilty of witchcraft, banished from the village during a particularly harsh winter and presumed dead.</p>

            <p>By midwinter all of Kedward's accusers along with half of the town's children vanish. Fearing a curse, the townspeople flee Blair and vow never to utter Elly Kedward's name again.</p>

            <p>Eleven witnesses testify to seeing a pale woman's hand reach up and pull ten-year-old Eileen Treacle into <a class="new_color" href="myth_sections/Tappy/Tappy1.html">Tappy East Creek</a>. Her body is never recovered, and for thirteen days after the drowning the creek is clogged with oily bundles of sticks.</p>

            <p>Eight-year-old Robin Weaver is reported missing and search parties are dispatched. Although Weaver returns, one of the search parties does not.

            <p>An old hermit named <a class="new_color" href="myth_sections/Parr/Parr1.html">Rustin Parr</a> walks into a local market and tells the people there that he is "finally finished." After Police hike for four hours to his secluded house in the woods, they find the bodies of seven missing children in the <a class="new_color" href="myth_sections/Parr/Parr4.html">cellar</a>. Each child has been ritualistically murdered and disemboweled. Parr admits to everything in detail, telling authorities that he did it for "an old woman ghost" who occupied the woods near his house. He is quickly convicted and hanged.</p>

            <p class="mini_width_custom font_static">October 20,<br>1994</p>
            <p>Montgomery College students <a class="new_color" href="filmmaker.html">Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams</a> arrive in Burkittsville to interview locals about the legend of the Blair Witch for a class project. Heather interviews <a class="new_color" href="myth_sections/Brown/Brown1.html">Mary Brown</a> an old and quite insane woman who has lived in the area all her life. Mary claims to have seen the Blair Witch one day near Tappy Creek in the form of a hairy, half-human, half-animal beast.</p>

        <div class="text_container">
            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">October 21,<br>1994</p>
            <p>In the early morning Heather interviews <a class="new_color" href="myth_sections/Fishermen/Fishermen1.html">two fishermen</a> who tell the filmmakers that Coffin Rock is less than twenty minutes from town and easily accessible by an old logging trail. The filmmakers hike into Black Hills Forest shortly thereafter and are never seen again.</p>

            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">October 26,<br>1994</p>
            <p>The Maryland State Police launch their search of the Black Hills area, an operation that lasts ten days and includes up to one hundred men aided by dogs, helicopters, and even a fly over by a Department of Defense Satellite.</p>

        <div class="text_container">
            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">November 5,<br>1994</p>
            <p>The search is called off after 33,000 man hours fail to find a trace of the filmmakers or any of their gear. Heather's mother, Angie Donahue, begins an exhaustive personal search for her daughter and her two companions.</p>

        <div class="text_container">
            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">June 19,<br>1995</p>
            <p>The case is declared inactive and unsolved.</p>

        <div class="text_container">
            <p class="mini_width_custom font_static">October 16,<br>1995</p>
            <p>Students from the University of Maryland's Anthropology Department discover a duffel bag containing <a class="new_color" href="legacy.html">film cans, DAT tapes, video-cassettes, a Hi-8 video camera, Heather's journal and a CP-16 film camera</a> buried under the foundation of a 100 year-old cabin. When the evidence is examined, Burkittsville Sheriff Ron Cravens announced that the 11 rolls of black and white film and 10 HI8 video tapes are indeed the property of Heather Donahue and her crew.</p>

        <div class="text_container">
            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">December 15,<br>1995</p>
            <p>After an initial study of the bag's contents, select pieces of film footage are shown to the families. According to Angie Donahue, there are several unusual events but nothing conclusive. The families question the thoroughness of the analysis and demanded another look.</p>

        <div class="text_container">
            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">February 19,<br>1996</p>
            <p>The families are shown a second group of clips that local law enforcement officials consider to be faked. Outraged, Mrs. Donahue goes public with her criticism and Sheriff Cravens restricts all access to the evidence; a restriction that two lawsuits fail to lift.</p>

            <p class="font_static mini_width_custom">March 1,<br>1996</p>
            <p>The Sheriff's department announces that the evidence is inconclusive and the case is once again declared inactive and unsolved. The footage is to be released to the families when the legal limit of its classification runs out, on October 16, 1997.</p>

            <p>The found footage of their children's last days is turned over to the families of Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams. Angie Donahue contracts <a class="new_color" href="http://www.haxan.com/" target="_blank">Haxan Films</a> to examine the footage and piece together the events of October 20 - 28, 1994.</p>
