            <p>Montgomery College students <a class="new_color" href="filmmaker.html">Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams</a> arrive in Burkittsville to interview locals about the legend of the Blair Witch for a class project. Heather interviews <a class="new_color">Mary Brown</a> an old and quite insane woman who has lived in the area all her life. Mary claims to have seen the Blair Witch one day near Tappy Creek in the form of a hairy, half-human, half-animal beast.</p>

            <p>In the early morning Heather interviews <a class="new_color">two fishermen</a> who tell the filmmakers that Coffin Rock is less than twenty minutes from town and easily accessible by an old logging trail.

            <p>The search is called off after 33,000 man hours fail to find a trace of the filmmakers or any of their gear. Heather's mother, Angie Donahue, begins an exhaustive personal search for her daughter and her two companions.</p>

            <p>Students from the University of Maryland's Anthropology Department discover a duffel bag containing <a class="new_color" href="legacy.html">film cans, DAT tapes, video-cassettes, a Hi-8 video camera, Heather's journal and a CP-16 film camera</a> buried under the foundation of a 100 year-old cabin. When the evidence is examined, Burkittsville Sheriff Ron Cravens announced that the 11 rolls of black and white film and 10 HI8 video tapes are indeed the property of Heather Donahue and her crew.</p>

            <p>After an initial study of the bag's contents, select pieces of film footage are shown to the families. According to Angie Donahue, there are several unusual events but nothing conclusive. The families question the thoroughness of the analysis and demanded another look.</p>

            <p>The families are shown a second group of clips that local law enforcement officials consider to be faked. Outraged, Mrs. Donahue goes public with her criticism and Sheriff Cravens restricts all access to the evidence; a restriction that two lawsuits fail to lift.</p>

            <p>The Sheriff's department announces that the evidence is inconclusive and the case is once again declared inactive and unsolved. The footage is to be released to the families when the legal limit of its classification runs out, on October 16, 1997.</p>

            <p>The found footage of their children's last days is turned over to the families of Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams. Angie Donahue contracts <a class="new_color" href="http://www.haxan.com/" target="_blank">Haxan Films</a> to examine the footage and piece together the events of October 20 - 28, 1994.</p>
