I was very calm tonight.  So I don't have to go through another day of mending fragile crew egos because I need to get my film shot.  They followed anyway.  Could it be that they sometimes do listen?  I don't know how they can go back to sleep.  I don't think they're sleeping actually.  I just think they don't want me in their face with...</p>

We're completely fucking lost now, we've decided basically to just keep heading south, but it doesn't see to be getting us anywhere fast and weird shit keeps happening which is, to be totally honest, sitting here with gloves and sweaters in a cold tent in the middle of nowhere and the guys asleep - beginning to scare me.
