            <p> I got them all on both 16 & video plus, I cut one down.  I probably shouldn't have, the guys freaked out a bit when I did it, but I want to be able to look at it objectively when we get out of here.
                We will laugh about this someday.
                (Right after we all have a bath, a beer, a big meal, and, well, let's face it, at this point a little nookie wouldn't be bad either)  Good night.  Please, God, or whatever, get us out of here...</p>

            <p>If I stop writing, I have to turn my light out and go to sleep.  I feel too acute right now to sleep, but there is nothing for me to do.  I can't keep shooting because I'll hear shit about having the video light on, and I feel bad about how things have gone thus far (even though not having the map was the ultimate screw).  I don't want to piss them off any more than I do just by BEING.  So here I ramble in this journal, probably making no sense at all.  Scribbling just to have something to do.  I have no idea how they can sleep.</p>

                a plane. he is UNREAL sometimes. My<br>

            <p>Shit, I didn't even mention the piles of rocks (3) around the tent this morning - it feels like ages ago.  Who would do such a thing?  And what was Mary Brown's story from the Bible about a pile of rocks?  I cannot FUCKING remember what she said about that because I was freaking out trying to keep the interview to two mags.  Maybe we at least have it on the DAT.  Something about what it means when the Lord hands you a pile of rocks.  I really wish I could remember.  I need any insight I can get at...</p>

            <p>Let's just get ourselves and our footage out of the woods safetly.  "Out of the woods" isn't that what they say when people are no longer in danger of death after an accident?   "Out of the woods."  How appropriate.  Goodnight, now again, for real.  I mean it, really, going to lie down now.  No shit.  I am.   No, really.</p>
