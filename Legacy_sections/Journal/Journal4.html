                Boyds trip. Too loud walkman already irritating<br>
                me. Far be it from me to turn away help. It<br>
                seems beggars can't be choosers. I feel like I<br> should throw a little party, buy a bottle of cuervo<br>
                or something - a little fiesta before the<br>
                potential hellshoot. Practical and theoretical<br>experience are 2 different things.</p>

        <p>This raises concerns for me, as far as Mike goes. I don't know him, but I think he'll be alright though. Tolerance. Preparation. Wits. Keeping one's wits. Squirrels. Fish. [Inuhim]. Keep [ucumberesqne]. Cool. Relaxed. Ready. Relaxed Readiness. Possibilities can be so ugly. Stay focused focused focused. Handle what is actually happening rather than freak about what could happen. How much to tell the boys? This is directly related to not worrying . . .</p>
