There doesn't seem to be to much sense in keeping watch except that one of us is always conscious and shitting our pants.  It is cold.  At least we're dry (From the calves up anyway).  Horrible hike through a marsh today.  I am evading the subject.  I am evading the subject of my fear.  I am trying desperately to hold my shit together... </p>

I stitched as much as I could of Mike's crotch hole tonight (That sounds bad, eh?).  I am on my last pair of dry socks.  I am hungry.  I have been wearing the same panties since we left.

Where is Josh?  Maybe he ran off for help like Mike says, but why did he leave all his stuff in the middle of the freezing night.  And why was it his...</p>
