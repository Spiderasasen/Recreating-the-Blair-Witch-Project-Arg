Mike was shitting his pants in the cemetary.   I don't know if it was because I found it or because he's scared.  My guess is he doesn't want to look like an asshole in front of Josh, but he's SCARED.  I am interested to see if anything happens.  Elly, are...</p>

The hardest thing about directing is dealing with people, it almost seems as if the smaller the number of people, the harder it is, because you're with them all the time.  I truly like these guys, Mike has turned out to be incredibly cool, and Josh, well, Josh, he's always a surprise.  Then again, he always works hard, as well as being hard to work with on occasion.
