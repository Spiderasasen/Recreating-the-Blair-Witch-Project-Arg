                    equipment tomorrow and shooting some tests.<br>

                    research (checking out some old<br>
                    documentary's on occultish things). I am hoping<br>

                    the film goes, as I have been so caught up with<br>
                    the details these past few weeks, I have had<br>
                    little thought time to devote to the actual<br>
                    aesthetic that I am going for. I am rather<br>
                    clueless in this department at the moment. I<br>can certain, however, that I'll know it when I<br>

He snoozes the alarm until 9 (was supposed to be 8:30) then gets directly in the shower now that I have to piss like a fucking racehorse, and he tells me to come in, that he's in the shower with the curtain shut. Not asking anyone if they might like to shower this morning (which I did). Well, I don't WANT to piss while you're in the shower, just like you didn't WANT to let the alarm go at 8:30 or ask anyone if they needed to use the shower. He went to the bagel place, so I went to Denny's, where I am right now. It's a matter of principle, leadership. Let's be clear. I was test loading the camera last night and my loop below the gate was too small so he's like "Oh, that doesn't sound good." WELL <span class="underline">NO</span> SHIT!</p>
